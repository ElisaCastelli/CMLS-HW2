# CMLS - HW2 - DISTORTION EFFECT PLUGIN

The aim of our project was to develop a distortion plugin using the JUCE framework.
Distortion is a non-linear effect used to alter the harmonic content of a sound or an instrument, usually by increasing their gain, producing a "dirty" tone.
	
Distortion effects can create a wide palette of sounds ranging from smooth, singing tones with long sustain to harsh, grungy effects.
	
In our plugin we decided to implement five kinds of distortion: Hard Clipping, Quadratic Soft Clipping, Exponential Soft Clipping, Full Wave Rectifier, Half Wave Rectifier. Each one has a different characteristic curve therefore a different sound timbre.
